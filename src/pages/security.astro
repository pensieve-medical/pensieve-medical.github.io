    <h1>Security</h1>
    <p>This placeholder page summarizes the security principles we follow to safeguard customer data.</p>

    <h2>Data protection</h2>
    <p>We use access controls, encryption in transit, and least-privilege practices to protect sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>Operational security</h2>
    <p>We monitor systems for suspicious activity and maintain logs to investigate and respond to incidents.</p>

    <h2>Vendor management</h2>
    <p>We use reputable service providers and review their security practices as part of our risk management process.</p>

    <h2>Aadhar verification (via DigiLocker)</h2>
    <p>We require Aadhar verification through DigiLocker to reduce fraud, deter misuse, and ensure that access to sensitive clinical media is limited to verified users.</p>

    <h2>Incident response</h2>
    <p>We maintain an incident response plan and notify impacted customers when required by law or contract.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For security questions or vulnerability reports, contact support.</p>
